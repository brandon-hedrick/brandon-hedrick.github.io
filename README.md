# Portfolio Project
Welcome to the current portfolio project of *Brandon Hedrick*. I'm currently in the process of development, but I welcome you to take a look. Things are still rapidly changing so be sure to come back and see how things have progressed!

This project is built on the default Gatsby starter.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
